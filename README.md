# Project Name: ExploreDK

ExploreDK is a responsive web-based application designed to enhance your hiking and camping experiences in Denmark. It helps you discover the best hiking trails, plan trips efficiently, and find ideal camping spots based on user preferences, real-time weather updates, and current trail conditions.

## Technical Description:

### Project Overview:
ExploreDK is a responsive web application that integrates AI using Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhanced user experience in planning hiking and camping trips across Denmark. It uses FastAPI for backend development and React for the frontend.

### Backend Structure:
The backend manages data storage, user authentication, and integration with third-party APIs. It is built using Python with the FastAPI framework, providing a fast and scalable solution. Data is stored in a PostgreSQL database, ensuring efficient management of hiking trail information, camping spot details, user profiles, and preferences.

### Frontend Structure:
The frontend is developed using modern web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (with the React framework). It offers a user-friendly interface for browsing hiking trails, viewing trail sections and elevation changes, exploring attractions, and selecting camping options. The frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs to fetch and display dynamic content.

### AI Integration:
ExploreDK utilizes LLMs to enhance user interaction and trip planning. Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms analyze user preferences and feedback to provide personalized trail recommendations and camping suggestions. LLMs also process real-time weather data and trail conditions, ensuring users receive timely updates and alerts during their trips.

## Possible Tech Stack:
- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (React), Bootstrap, Mapbox (for interactive maps)
- **AI/ML:** LangChain for working with LLMs, Weather APIs for real-time updates
- **Deployment:** Docker, AWS (Amazon Web Services) for hosting, Nginx for web server

## Detailed Implementation:

### Data Collection:
- **User Data:** Collect and store user preferences, activities, and feedback in the database.
- **Trail and Camping Data:** Maintain a detailed database of trails and camping spots with attributes such as length, elevation, type of scenery, facilities, etc.
- **External Data:** Integrate third-party APIs for real-time weather and trail condition data.

### Machine Learning Models:
1. **LLM for Personalized Recommendations:**
   - **Input:** User queries in natural language.
   - **Output:** Personalized trail and camping recommendations.
   - **Tools:** LangChain library.

2. **LLM for Sentiment and Trend Analysis:**
   - **Input:** User reviews, social media posts.
   - **Output:** Current trail conditions, popular spots, detected issues.
   - **Tools:** LangChain library.

### Backend Integration:
1. **FastAPI Setup:**
   - Create endpoints for user interactions, recommendations, and real-time updates.
   - Integrate the OpenAI API to process and respond to user inputs for recommendations and sentiment analysis.

2. **Database Management:**
   - Use SQLAlchemy for ORM to interact with PostgreSQL.
   - Manage user data, trail and camping information, and real-time data efficiently.

3. **Task Scheduling:**
   - Use Celery with FastAPI for periodic tasks to fetch and process real-time data from external APIs.

### Frontend Integration:
- **User Interface:** Develop a conversational interface where users can describe what they are looking for in natural language.
- **Display Recommendations:** Show personalized recommendations based on the LLM's output.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Display insights from sentiment and trend analysis in a user-friendly manner.

## Recommendation process:

Step 1: Ask 5 questions that can help recommend campsites.
Step 2: User answers the 5 questions
Step 3: Based on user answers AI recommends campsites

## Deployment:
- **Containerization:** Use Docker to containerize the FastAPI backend and React frontend.
- **Hosting:** Deploy the application on AWS, using services like EC2 for servers and RDS for the PostgreSQL database.
- **Web Server:** Use Nginx as a reverse proxy to handle incoming requests and serve the application.

By integrating LLMs like GPT-4, ExploreDK provides a dynamic and personalized user experience, enhancing the planning and enjoyment of hiking and camping trips in Denmark.
